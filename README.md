# Maxi-Taxi-Backend

This backend serves to connect both the Drivers Side and The Passenger's Side of the Maxi Taxi Check In Check Out system.
It is used to add user information, add transactions, get transactions for a specific driver and get driver's information.

This is currently being hosted on [Heroku](http://checkin-checkout-backend.herokuapp.com).
